## Description

WordPress AJAX calls are not cached and load the entire WordPress environment including all active plugins and the activated theme. 

This plugin allows you to specify which plugins your AJAX call requires to complete a task. This feature allows you to save server resources and increase completion speed. 

This mu-plugin was developed to help improve speed for [Inbound Now's](https://www.inboundnow.com) frontend ajax calls. 
 

## Install

1. Drop fast-ajax.php directly into /wp-content/mu-plugins/.
2. You are done!

## Usage

```
jQuery.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: ajaxurl,
    data: {
        action: 'some_special_action', /* dummy action */
        special_data: data, /* dummy data */
        fast_ajax: true, /* this data key must be set to true to enable fast ajax mode */
        load_plugins: ["plugin-directory/plugin-file.php"] /* notice here we are using a JSON string to declare which plugins we are wanting to load for this operation */
    },
    dataType: 'json',
    timeout: 20000,
    success: function (response) {
        console.log(response);
        /* handle actions here */
    },
    error: function (request, status, err) {
        console.log(err);
        /* handle error here */
    }
});
```
